# GoatSite
This is the personal portfolio website of Todd Goates and was built with Angular 5.0.0. It will be hosted on AWS and is designed from the ground up to be completely serverless.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See the Deployment section below for notes on how to deploy the project to AWS.

### Prerequisites
Your machine should have the following installed:
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli)

### Installation
Once you have the prerequisites installed, clone this repo onto your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/toddgoates/goatsite.git
```

Then navigate to the local repo in your terminal and install the required packages with:

```
npm install
```

### Development server

Run `ng serve -o` to start up a dev server. This will automatically open up a tab in your browser to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will instantly reload in your browser if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Deployment
TODO:  Coming soon!
